		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Database Schema Setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up Cargo.toml dependencies, 2) Creating the schema.rs file with table definitions, 3) Creating migration files, and 4) Setting up database connection configuration. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up database schema files and configurations which requires moderate complexity. It includes adding dependencies to Cargo.toml, creating schema definitions, setting up migrations, and configuring the database connection. While the task provides examples, it still requires understanding of Diesel ORM, database schema design, and Rust integration. Breaking it into 4 subtasks would make it more manageable."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the API Endpoints task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the basic module structure, 2) Implementing the health check endpoint, 3) Creating the route configuration system, 4) Setting up placeholder routes for users and products, and 5) Configuring the main application to use the routes. For each subtask, include implementation details and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the API structure for the application, which requires understanding of Actix-web framework, route configuration, and API design. It includes setting up multiple files, implementing a health check endpoint, and creating a route configuration system. The complexity comes from needing to design an extensible API structure that will accommodate future endpoints. Five subtasks would help organize the implementation logically."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "User Authentication Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Authentication Module into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the auth module structure, 2) Implementing the JWT token creation functionality, 3) Implementing token validation, 4) Creating the User model with password handling, 5) Implementing password hashing and verification, and 6) Adding necessary dependencies. Include specific implementation details and security considerations for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing authentication which is security-critical and complex. It requires understanding of JWT tokens, secure password hashing (Argon2), and user authentication flows. The implementation must be secure against common vulnerabilities. The complexity is increased by the need to properly handle cryptographic functions and securely store user credentials. Six subtasks would help address each security-critical component separately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Product Catalog Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Product Catalog Module into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the catalog module structure, 2) Implementing the Product and related models, 3) Creating the ProductService with CRUD operations, 4) Implementing the filtering functionality, and 5) Adding necessary dependencies. For each subtask, include implementation details and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a product catalog with inventory management functionality. It requires implementing multiple data models and a service layer with CRUD operations and filtering capabilities. The complexity comes from implementing business logic for product management and filtering. While not as security-critical as authentication, it still requires careful implementation to ensure proper inventory tracking and product management. Five subtasks would provide a logical breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Shopping Cart API",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Shopping Cart API task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the cart module structure, 2) Implementing the CartItem and Cart models, 3) Creating the CartService with core operations, 4) Implementing the cart API endpoints, 5) Integrating with the authentication system, 6) Integrating with the product catalog, and 7) Implementing inventory validation. For each subtask, include implementation details and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it integrates multiple systems (authentication, product catalog) and implements business logic for shopping cart management. It requires implementing models, services, and API endpoints while ensuring proper authentication and inventory validation. The complexity is increased by the need to handle concurrent cart operations and maintain data consistency. Seven subtasks would help manage this complexity by separating concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Frontend Components task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the project structure and dependencies, 2) Creating the App component with routing, 3) Implementing the Header component, 4) Implementing the Footer component, 5) Creating the HomePage component, 6) Implementing the ProductList component, 7) Creating placeholder components (ProductDetail, Cart, Login, Register), and 8) Setting up the theme and styling. For each subtask, include implementation details and UI/UX considerations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complete frontend structure with multiple React components, routing, and styling. It requires understanding of React, React Router, Material UI, and frontend architecture. The complexity comes from needing to create a cohesive user interface with multiple interconnected components. While the task provides code examples, implementing a complete frontend requires careful planning for component hierarchy, state management, and styling. Eight subtasks would help organize the implementation by component."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Integration Tests task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the test infrastructure, 2) Implementing health check tests, 3) Creating authentication tests, 4) Implementing product API tests, 5) Creating cart API tests, and 6) Implementing end-to-end user flow tests. For each subtask, include specific test scenarios, setup requirements, and validation criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating comprehensive integration tests for the entire application, which is highly complex. It requires understanding of testing frameworks, mocking, and the entire application architecture. The tests must verify the functionality of multiple interconnected systems including authentication, product catalog, and shopping cart. The complexity is increased by the need to set up test data, mock services, and validate complex workflows. Six subtasks would help organize the tests by functional area."
