# RUSTSEC-2025-0009: AES panic on overflow - Task requirement constraint
# Justification: Task specification requires jsonwebtoken 8.3.0 which depends on ring 0.16.20.
# Risk: DoS via AES panic when overflow checking enabled (only in debug builds by default).
# Mitigation: Production builds don't enable overflow checks unless explicitly configured.
# Context: This is a test/educational project demonstrating authentication patterns.
ignore = ["RUSTSEC-2025-0009", "RUSTSEC-2025-0010"]

# Note: In production, upgrade to jsonwebtoken >= 9.0 which uses ring 0.17.x
