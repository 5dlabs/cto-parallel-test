# Task requirement: jsonwebtoken 8.3.0 is explicitly specified in task/task.md
# This version depends on ring 0.16.20 which has known vulnerabilities:
# - RUSTSEC-2025-0009: Some AES functions may panic when overflow checking is enabled
# - RUSTSEC-2025-0010: Versions of ring prior to 0.17 are unmaintained
#
# JUSTIFICATION for ignoring:
# The task requirements (Task 3: User Authentication Module) explicitly mandate
# jsonwebtoken = "8.3.0". Upgrading to a newer version would violate task specifications.
#
# RISK ASSESSMENT:
# - The AES panic issue (RUSTSEC-2025-0009) is low-risk for JWT operations
# - JWT uses HMAC-SHA256 for signing, not AES encryption
# - The ring dependency is only used for cryptographic primitives by jsonwebtoken
#
# MITIGATION:
# - Monitor for jsonwebtoken 9.x or 10.x that uses ring >= 0.17
# - Plan upgrade path after task completion
# - Document this technical debt in project documentation
#
# Date added: 2025-11-14
# Review date: After Task 3 completion
